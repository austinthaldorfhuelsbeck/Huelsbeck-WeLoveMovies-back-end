# WeLoveMovies: Backend Capstone Project

## A RESTful API designed using Express, PostgreSQL and Knex.

### Synopsis

This project provided the opportunity to design a complex API, create a database, and connect to a frontend.

### Challenges

One key challenge of this assignment was managing libraries/dependencies. Many of the middleware functions and configuration files require dependencies to function properly: CORS, Knex, and Dotenv are examples. Students are given a relatively blank slate to start, and completing the assignment correctly required installing a number of libraries and running a number of CLI commands.

One other significant challenge was selecting the correct data using Knex, setting up tables correctly, and testing this accurately using Postman and DBeaver. Less visual feedback is available when developing an API than a frontend, so it was up to me to figure out how to check if things were working.

### Connecting Concepts

This project feels to me like my first real shot at seeing a full-stack application tick. I had to get into the weeds a bit in order to connect my project to the frontend Thinkful provided. I took the liberty of studying the frontend project to understand how its `api.js` utility functions work, where environment variables are stored, and how Effect hooks are used to display the fetched information.
